# Linux Networking 

## Intro 

There are plenty of guides online if you want to learn about networking in Linux. I wrote this particular manuscript while working on a “How-To” instructional guide on Linux basic network configuration components. 

Why it is important to understand Linux Networking?

Server Operations: Many Linux systems are used as servers that provide services over a network. Understanding networking is essential for setting up and managing services such as web servers, database servers, and file servers.
Remote Access: Linux systems are often accessed remotely via SSH (Secure Shell). Knowing networking concepts ensures secure and efficient remote management.

Security: Understanding networking helps to secure Linux systems by implementing firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other security measures.

- Note: For practice student use assigned Linux VM.

## Network IP Configuration 
```
cd /etc/sysconfig/networ-scripts/ifcfg-eth0/ens 
ifconfig /all 
ip addr show
```
## DNS Domain name server

```
cat /etc/resolv.conf 
# DNS Name server 
nameserver 1.1.1.1
```
## Host name control without DNS 

```
cat /etc/hosts
my-vm-name 192.168.0.1 
```

## Default Route 

Example of your home internet modem and default route.
