## Pre-Requisite Softwares
- SSH tools: Putty, Super Putty, Mobaxterm
- FTP tools: WinSCP, Filezilla, Cyberduck

## Linux File Structure

- Linux file system is case-sensitive. (Zaftch and zaftch are different)
- Hidden files start with a `.` (dot) extension. `.` refers to the current directory.

### Directories in Redhat OS

- `/` : Root directory.
- `/home` : Contains home directories for all users to store their personal files.
  - Example: `/home/student` or `/home/zaftch`
- `/bin` : Contains commands and binary files accessible by users (e.g., `mkdir`, `ls`, `cd`, `ps`).
- `/sbin` : Contains commands and files accessible only by the root user (e.g., `ifconfig`, `reboot`, `shutdown`).
- `/etc` : Contains configuration files.
- `/lib` : Contains system libraries.
- `/proc` : Contains process information.
- `/tmp` : Contains temporary files.
- `/usr` : Contains binaries and libraries for user applications and software (e.g., WASIHS, DB2).
- `/var` : Contains variable files such as logs (`/var/log`), emails (`/var/mail`), and temp files (`/var/tmp`).
- `/dev` : Contains device files (e.g., USB devices).

## Navigation and Directory Control Commands

- `mkdir` : Make or create a directory.
