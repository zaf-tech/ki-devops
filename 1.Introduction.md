# Introduction 

Linux  started  around  1991  by  Linus  Torlvads. 
Linux  is  an  multi-user, multitasking  Operating  System. 
Linux  is  Open  Source  not like  AIX , Sun  Solaris, HP-UX... 
Linux  is  “case-sensitive” ls  is  different of LS. 

## Linux Distributions
1. Redhat  
2. CentOS 
3. Ubuntu. 
4. SuSe Linux 
5. Fedora 
6. Gentoo 
7. Mandriva. 
8. Debian. 
9. Slackware 


## Windows Pre-packed OS VS Linux Pre-packed OS 

- Windows usually is shipped on 1 CD which seems very convenient but this one CD contains only the windows operating system
- Linux operating system can be installed from a floppy disk.
- The amount of CD’s that come with most distributions only reflect the amount of packages that come pre-packed with the distribution


## Linux Programs VS Windows Programs

- Office 
  - Windows : Microsoft Office 
  - Linux : Open Office / KOffice 
  - Microsoft Office : Outlook Linux : Kontac
  - Linux: Kontact
- Graphics 
  - Windows : Adobe Photoshop 
  - Linux: GIMP 
  - Windows: Microsoft Visio 
  - Linux: DIA Adobe Acrobat available under Win/Linux


## Linux for Developers 
- Windows 
  - Comes practically with no IDE, compilers or what so ever 
- Linux 
  - Comes pre-packed with the following
  - GCC ( C++ compiler for linux ) 
  - Perl ( Available under Win/Linux) 
  - Python ( Available under Win/Linux) 
  - Java ( GNU Java & Comes with Eclipse ) 
  - PHP ( Comes pre-packed with Apache ) 
  - wxWindows/QT ( Toolkit for cross platform development)


## Linux Web Server (Apache)
- The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP standards
- Apache has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April 1996 
- The November 2005 Netcraft Web Server Survey found that more than 70% of the web sites on the Internet are using Apache, thus making it more widely used than all other web servers combined. 


## Samba
- Samba is software that can be run on a platform other than Microsoft Windows, for example, UNIX, Linux, IBM System 390, OpenVMS, and other operating systems.
- Samba uses the TCP/IP protocol that is installed on the host server
- When correctly configured, it allows that host to interact with a Microsoft Windows client or server as if it is a Windows file and print server.


## Software Update Tools 
- APT 
  - Is a package management system used by Debian and its derivatives but it has since been modified to work with RPMpackages via apt-rpm 
- YUM 
  - The Yellow Dog Updater, Modified (yum for short) acts as a package manager for RPM-compatible Linux computer systems. Its principal advantages over the RPM version of apt are its smaller codebase and better dependency handling.


## What are the package types ?
- RPM —RPMPackage Manager, but originally Red Hat Package Manager, originally from Red Hat but now used by many other distributors as well 
- deb —Debian package, originally from Debian but also used by others 
- tgz or tar.gz — standard tar + gzip control files — used by Slackware , possibly with some extra and others, or sometimes when distributing very simple handmade packages
- ebuild —the file containing information on how to retrieve, compile, and install a package in Gentoo 's Portage the command emerge . 
- src — building the packages from source (often binary packages are provided in parallel on many systems). 


# Linux from a shell point of view
## What is a shell ?
- command line interpreter
- End point to connect ( Remote Host Name or IP address )
- Authorization/ Account ( i.e User Name and Password )
  
##  Obtaining an Account
- If you are a professional , it’s likely that your company already has some UNIX facilities. To access those facilities you will be given a username and password to access that system via a shell account
- The good thing about having your own version of Linux which in our case is to be a super user on your own machine. 
- By default the super user “referred to as root” is the only person on the system that has higher privileges than normal users were he is allowed to run services , add/remove users and so forth

## Logging In
- Logging In
- The username and system password are assigned to you by the system administrator
- The username and password are case sensitive
  - Host name : remote host/ Ip address 
  - Port : Communication Port
  - Login : user name
  - Password : Secret 

## Shell 
- The $ or % prompt you see when you first log in is displayed by a special kind of a program called a shell. 
- A shell is a program that acts as a middleman between you and the raw UNIX/LINUX machine
- Three most popular shells are 
  - Bourne Shell 
  - Korn Shell 
  - C Shel
