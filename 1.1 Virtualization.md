# Slide 1: Understanding Virtualization

```
What is Virtualization?
Definition: Virtualization is a technology that creates virtual (rather than actual) versions of resources such as servers, storage, and networks.
How It Works: Uses software called a hypervisor to abstract physical hardware and create multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical server.
Key Concept: Each VM operates independently and can run its own operating system and applications.
Benefits of Virtualization
Cost Efficiency: Reduces hardware costs by maximizing resource usage.
Flexibility: Allows for easy resource allocation and management.
Isolation: Ensures that VMs are isolated from each other, enhancing security and stability.
Scalability: Facilitates quick scaling up or down of resources as needed.
Types of Virtualization
Server Virtualization: Consolidates multiple physical servers into virtual servers.
Network Virtualization: Creates a virtual network within a physical network.
Storage Virtualization: Combines multiple physical storage devices into a single storage unit.

#Slide 2: Virtualization in Cloud Computing

```
Virtualization in Cloud Computing
Foundation of Cloud Services: Virtualization is the core technology that enables cloud computing, providing flexible and scalable resources over the internet.
Resource Pooling: Cloud providers use virtualization to pool physical resources and deliver them as needed to users.
Cloud Example: Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2
Service Overview: AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the cloud.
How It Works: Users create virtual machines (instances) on AWS's physical infrastructure using virtualization technology.
Hypervisor: AWS uses a custom hypervisor to manage VMs efficiently.
Instance Types: Various instance types are available, each with different performance characteristics and pricing.
Benefits:
Scalability: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
Cost Savings: Pay only for the resources you use.
Global Reach: Deploy instances in multiple regions worldwide for better performance and redundancy.
Real-World Example
Scenario: A startup needs a reliable, scalable web server.
Without Cloud: They would need to purchase and maintain physical servers.
With Cloud (AWS EC2): They can quickly launch VMs, scale them as traffic increases, and pay only for the actual usage.
Result: Significant savings in time and money, with the ability to respond dynamically to changing needs.
